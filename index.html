<div class="post-content"> <p><span>It doesn&#x2019;t matter if you are telecommuting due to COVID-19, or you deliberately chose a job with that perk. When you join the work-from-home world, you need a place to do your productive best. The following five tips will teach you how to set up the perfect home office customized for your unique needs.&#xA0;</span></p>
<h2><b>1. Location, Location, Location</b></h2>
<p><span>Real estate agents love using this phrase, but it matters when setting up your home office, too. That room above your garage might be ideal for storage, but unless you </span><a href="https://homeguides.sfgate.com/make-room-above-garage-warmer-58586.html"><span>insulate the ceiling beneath</span></a><span>, you&#x2019;ll freeze all workday long. It&#x2019;s tough to type with cold, stiff fingers, and harder to concentrate when you&#x2019;re shivering.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>Likewise, areas like your kitchen might seem ideal because you have a table, which can save you money on a desk. However, the constant </span><a href="https://www.marylandsunrooms.com/home-offices.html"><span>temptation to get up and snack</span></a><span> can crush your productivity. Don&#x2019;t even try working from your couch in front of the television &#x2014; unless you enjoy the feeling of getting nothing done.</span></p>

<h2><b>2. Make It Ergonomic&#xA0;</b></h2>
<p><span>Back pain remains </span><a href="https://www.acatoday.org/Patients/What-is-Chiropractic/Back-Pain-Facts-and-Statistics"><span>the single leading cause of disability</span></a><span>, and way too much of it stems from sitting too long on a hard chair. Fortunately, you no longer have to rely on the model HR provides.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>You might not go with a traditional desk-and-chair setup for your home office. Many folks switch to variable-height desks that let them alternately sit and stand, and some users claim it helps back strain. If you are on a shoestring, you can stack boxes under your monitor to create the same effect. Moving more frequently helps compensate for a less-than-perfect seat.</span></p>
<p><span>An inflatable exercise ball is another cost-effective solution. It engages your core muscles and burns calories while you work. Plus, you can lean back and stretch your lumbar region as often as necessary while barely breaking your stride.</span></p>

<h2><b>3. Improve Your Lighting</b></h2>
<p><span>A recent survey by the American Optometric Association reveals that over half of all Americans </span><a href="https://www.ehstoday.com/ppe/eye-face-head/article/21917665/most-americans-experience-digital-eye-strain-from-overexposure-to-computers#:~:text=The%20average%20U.S.%20worker%20spends,problems%20as%20a%20direct%20result."><span>experience digital eye strain</span></a><span> due to computer use. Research how to use your devices&#x2019; twilight settings or invest in blue light-cutting glasses.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>Likewise, if you have to squint to read your budget report in low lighting, you could develop headaches &#x2014; but bright fluorescent overheads can trigger migraines. Instead, use natural lighting whenever possible by throwing open your shades. If this option won&#x2019;t work because sunbeams glare up your screen, a desk lamp with an adjustable neck lets you shine illumination where needed.&#xA0;</span></p>
<h2><b>4. Eliminate Distractions&#xA0;</b></h2>
<p><span>If you are fortunate, you have a dedicated home office with a door you can close. However, the reality of COVID means many families are sharing quarters and workspaces. How can you eliminate distractions like chattering children and your roommate&#x2019;s video games?&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-noise-cancelling-headphones/"><span>set of noise-canceling headphones</span></a><span> can free you from auditory distractions. If you have times when you need quiet but not a silent location, invent a signal to let those who share your home know when to keep it down. If your co-workers don&#x2019;t mind you showing up to video calls wearing headgear, you could put on a dedicated &#x201C;thinking cap&#x201D; that means, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m in a meeting.&#x201D; Otherwise, keep a blazer over your chair to wear only for such occasions.&#xA0;</span></p>

<h2><b>5. Add a Personal Touch&#xA0;</b></h2>
<p><span>Finally, your home is your castle &#x2014; make your office as personal as you like it. Photos of your children or your favorite vacation spot remind you of why you grind hard every day. A basketball hoop mounted above your trash adds a touch of fun to your day.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p><span>While you don&#x2019;t want to kick back too much, it&#x2019;s OK to add touches of comfort. Go ahead and wrap yourself in that afghan your granny knitted or let your </span><span>favorite citrus-scented essential oil</span><span> energize your mood when you add a few drops to your diffuser.&#xA0;</span></p>
