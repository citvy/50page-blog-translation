<div class="wrapper--detail__body"> <p>Eventually, these devices will achieve seamless connectivity through IoT technology, bridging personal devices with smart buildings and their own companies&#x2019; platforms.</p> <p>Therefore, beyond simply measuring occupancy, a true human-centric approach of workplace analytics will monitor key aspects such as health, levels of stress, emotional states, and social behaviour.</p> <p>Establishing patterns between these physiological factors and the office environment (i.e. noise levels, lighting and air quality, furniture settings, location) as well as their combined impact in productivity will elevate the conversations about workplace design, management practices, and employees&apos; well-being.</p> <p>Multiple studies have shown that productivity can be measured through methods such as keystrokes and mouse clicks. According to some studies, wearable devices, such as accelerometers, are also regarded as highly effective tools to measure employees&#x2019; stress levels, with an accuracy of as high as over 90%.</p> <p>Combining data from these devices with e-calendar information could be used to explore correlation between physiological stress and employees&#x2019; work-related engagements.</p> </div>
