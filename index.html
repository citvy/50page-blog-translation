</div> <h2>What is Stock Sentiment?</h2>
<p>In investing, sentiment generally means whether or not a given security is in favor with investors. It is typically a pretty short-term metric that relies entirely on technical analysis. That means it doesn&#x2019;t incorporate anything to do with the health or profitability of the underlying company.</p>
<p>Price action is generally the best indicator of sentiment. For a stock to go up, investors must feel good about it. Similarly, a stock that is in a downtrend must be out of favor.</p>
<p><em>InvestorsObserver</em>&#x2019;s Sentiment Indicator considers price action and recent trends in volume. Increasing volumes often mean that a trend is strengthening, while decreasing volumes can signal that a reversal could come soon.</p>
<p>The options market is another place to get signals about sentiment. Since options allow investors to place bets on the price of a stock, we consider the ratio of calls and puts for stocks where options are available. </p>
