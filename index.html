<p class="p1">Valdez said the district is also ahead in the number of payments received as compared to last year. The receipts reflect income as of Tuesday, Nov. 17.</p>
<p class="p1">The overall tax levy the district is responsible for collecting is $42.6 million.</p>
<p class="p1">He said the district has collected $1.75 million in taxes since Oct. 31, and has thus far remained only open by appointment to the public.</p>
<p class="p1">Directors J Allen Carnes and Tony Moreno were not present for the meeting, which also included an appraisal program summary, and a regional economic outlook report.</p>
<p class="p1">During the regional overview, Valdez said that real estate trends, building permit trends, and deed transfers indicate a healthy regional economy.</p>
<p class="p1">&#x201C;The market continues out there, &#x2026;[building] permits, [home] sales, prices continue to go up in the middle of a pandemic,&#x201D; Valdez said in summary.</p>
<p class="p1">As of early November, 427 building permits have been filed in Uvalde County, as compared to 438 in 2019 and 360 in 2018. Similarly, deed filings tally 1,260, up from 1,159 in 2019.</p>
<p class="p1">In their action, the board approved the minutes for <span class="s1">the regular meeting held Oct. 20, and the district&#x2019;s financial report through Oct. 30.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Directors also approved the appointments of Eugene Verstuyft, Katherine Ann Gourley, William Watson and Richard B. Taylor to serve as Agricultural Advisory Board members for 2021-22. Newly-approved Appraisal Review Board members include Raymond Velos, Walter W. Tidwell and Anthony J. Rock. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other items approved by the board include the employee health benefit pool transition to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas as of Oct. 1, 2021.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Texas Municipal League Health Benefit Pool approached the district to inform of a switch in provider of services to BCBS, and the option to change the district&#x2019;s deductible start date.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#x201C;They asked us if we wanted to do a change in the start date &#x2013;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#xA0; </span>right now under the current plan, the new year starts in October but the deductible starts in January, so there&#x2019;s always issues and concerns for those three months,&#x201D; Valdez said.&#xA0;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the change in providers, the board approved the district aligning the policy start date with the deductible start date.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The board of directors also approved<span class="Apple-converted-space">&#xA0; </span>giving Valdez authority to modify appraisal district operations and staffing in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
