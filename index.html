<p>Move Inc., the company that runs Realtor.com, saw a drop in revenues last quarter, as parent company News Corp. also took a hit.</p>
<p>Susan Panuccio, News Corp.&#x2019;s chief financial officer, said in an earnings call Thursday that Move&#x2019;s revenues had &#x201C;declined 10 percent to $111 million, with real estate evenues down 5 percent.&#x201D; She blamed the loss &#x201C;almost entirely&#x201D; on a customer-billing relief program, and said Move was still adjusting to a <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2020/02/07/news-corp-looks-to-opcity-lead-generation-to-boost-real-estate-services-biz/">referral model</a>.</p>
<h4>Read more</h4> <p>Despite the tumbling revenues, Panuccio said traffic to Realtor.com was surging: The website had 86 million unique monthly users in June &#x2014; up 18 percent on the same time last year.</p>
<p>News Corp., which owns a host of businesses on top of its staple of newspapers, saw quarterly revenues drop to $1.92 billion in the quarter &#x2014; down 22 percent from the same time last year. The company <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2014/09/30/news-corp-to-buy-operator-of-real-estate-listing-websites/">purchased Move</a> in 2014 for nearly $1 billion.</p>
<p>Revenues across the company&#x2019;s digital real estate services portfolio, which includes Australia&#x2019;s REA Group, were down 16 percent to $238 million, Panuccio said, noting a &#x201C;decline in listings in Australia and the U.S.&#x201D; On an adjusted basis, the decline was 13 percent.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the pandemic loomed large over the Thursday call, and Panuccio said staff cuts had been made in the real estate side of the business.</p>
<p>News Corp. CEO Robert Thomson said the crisis had &#x201C;irrevocably changed businesses &#x2014; and our businesses &#x2014; in expediting preexisting digital trends, challenging established business practices, and in prompting necessary in prospecton about work habits and the workplace itself.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Discussing traffic to the company&#x2019;s listings sites, he said the pandemic had also &#x201C;prompted many families to consider their housing&#x201D; in Australia, and noted similar trends in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We saw a significant improvement in profitability at Move, which runs the Realtor.com site, in the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole,&#x201D; he added.</p>
