Zoom meetings are changing the way families think about space and privacy. Home offices are in high demand. Backyards are more desirable than parks and gyms. Work-from-home policies are eliminating the commute for many. There&apos;s an endless list of considerations.&quot;&#xA0;</p><p>Millions of people are considering moves for a slew of reasons, mostly to right-size their living spaces or get closer to family, he added. With some employers not expecting to bring workers back into the office until there&apos;s a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/">Covid-19</a> vaccine, the work-from-home norm could last several more months.&#xA0;</p></div><div id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-105844056" class="PlaceHolder-wrapper"></div><div class="group"><p>Companies could also fundamentally change how they want employees in the office. Zillow will offer its employees the option to work remotely at least part-time indefinitely, while <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TWTR">Twitter</a>&#xA0;and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TEAM">Atlassian</a> have both said employees can work from home indefinitely.</p><p>The pandemic also has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/coronavirus-update-people-flee-cities-to-live-in-suburbs.html">accelerated trends</a> of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/coronavirus-update-people-flee-cities-to-live-in-suburbs.html">people fleeing large, expensive U.S. cities</a>.&#xA0;While home shopping is up everywhere, Barton said the company is seeing a &quot;deceleration of migration&quot; to cities and expects it to continue.&#xA0;</p><p>&quot;We are pretty confident that this is going to be a lasting, multiyear meaningful trend,&quot; Barton said. &quot;We can&apos;t call exactly how it&apos;s going to play out from the data yet. But from an intuition supported by some bit of data, it seems like something real.&quot;</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CNBC?sub_confirmation=1"><em><strong>Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.</strong></em></a></p></div><div id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-106654048" class="PlaceHolder-wrapper"><div class="InlineVideo-videoEmbed" id="InlineVideo-0"><div class="InlineVideo-wrapper"></div></div></div></div></div>
