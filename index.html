Jobs in the financial sector are still looking to recover as the sector lost 18,000 jobs. In June it saw 65,000 new jobs.

<h3><strong>ADP National Franchise Report &#x2013; July 2020</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://adpemploymentreport.com/2020/July/NFR/docs/NFRinfographic-July-2020.pdf">Franchise businesses</a> have seen encouraging growth in new hires as businesses opened up in July. In fact, July saw growth by almost three-quarters (21,200) of the growth seen in June (4,500).</p>
<p>restaurants and car dealerships spearheaded the positive growth in July adding a combined gross of new workforce totaling 31,000. Food retailers, business services, accommodations and real estate had seen an aggregate loss of 7,100 jobs.</p>
<p>The increase in job growth from the previous month does come with a cautionary tale. Even though job losses from accommodation have dropped from 5,400 to 600 in July food retailers, business services, accommodations and real estate continue to grapple on how to make a comeback. Due to a combination of uncertainty and health concerns their growth remains inhibited to absorb additional manpower.</p> <p><strong> <img class="ezlazyload wp-image-909848 aligncenter" src="https://cdn-0.smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NFRinfographic-July-2020.png" alt width="850" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" srcset="https://cdn-0.smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NFRinfographic-July-2020.png 2500w, https://cdn-0.smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NFRinfographic-July-2020-109x150.png 109w, https://cdn-0.smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NFRinfographic-July-2020-742x1024.png 742w, https://cdn-0.smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NFRinfographic-July-2020-768x1060.png 768w, https://cdn-0.smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NFRinfographic-July-2020-1113x1536.png 1113w, https://cdn-0.smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NFRinfographic-July-2020-1484x2048.png 1484w, https://cdn-0.smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NFRinfographic-July-2020-300x414.png 300w, https://cdn-0.smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NFRinfographic-July-2020-660x911.png 660w, https://cdn-0.smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NFRinfographic-July-2020-850x1173.png 850w, https://cdn-0.smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NFRinfographic-July-2020-620x855.png 620w"></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Bottom Line </strong></h3>
<p>July&#x2019;s figure indicates cautious optimism in regards to the job market among small businesses. April and May had shown gloomy figures with job losses registering 6 million and 43,500 respectively. At the peak of the pandemic in April, the nation saw an excess of 20 million job losses.</p>
<p>July also saw nonfarm payroll employment rising by 1.8 million with the unemployment <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">falling by 10.2%.</a> The number of workers who usually work part-time also rose by 803,000 to 24.0 million. The number of unemployed who were on temporary layoff decreased by 1.3 million in July to 9.2 million.<span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146" class="ezoic-adpicker-ad"></span><span class="ezoic-ad large-mobile-banner-1 adtester-container adtester-container-146"><span id="div-gpt-ad-smallbiztrends_com-large-mobile-banner-1-0" class="ezoic-ad"></span></span></p>
<p>This is by about half its April level. The Bureau for Labor statistics attributes the improvement in the labor market to the resumption of economic activity curtailed by COVID-19.</p> <p>In July, the Bureau reports of notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality, government, retail trade, professional and business services, other services, and health care. July also saw the number of unemployed Americans falling by 1.4 million to 16.3 million.</p>
