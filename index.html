Doug Ducey has extended eviction protections for thousands of tenants affected by COVID-19, renters throughout the pandemic have&#xA0;fallen behind on payments <a href="/story/money/business/consumers/2020/06/29/thousands-arizonans-could-become-homeless-summer-after-governors-order-delaying-evictions-expires/3210835001/">after layoffs, pay cuts and mounting medical bills</a>.&#xA0;Thousands of Arizona renters have submitted applications seeking help from emergency programs.&#xA0;</li><li>Phoenix area&#xA0;rents have increased by <a href="/story/money/real-estate/catherine-reagor/2020/05/10/coronavirus-pandemic-metro-phoenix-area-apartments-rent-increase-us-average/5179104002/">almost 40% since 2014</a>, while the area&#x2019;s incomes haven&#x2019;t climbed at nearly the same pace.&#xA0;The metro Phoenix median home price&#xA0;<a href="/story/money/real-estate/catherine-reagor/2020/04/26/metro-phoenix-home-prices-hit-record-march-but-sales-slowing/3014881001/">hit a record</a> in March.</li><li><a href="/story/news/local/phoenix/2020/03/02/arizona-silver-tsunami-grows-west-valley-looks-open-senior-homeless-shelter/4863073002/">A &quot;silver tsunami&quot;</a>&#xA0;of older adults are losing their homes&#xA0;as rents outstrip their incomes.&#xA0;</li><li>The number of people living without shelter in the Phoenix area has jumped 200%&#xA0;since 2014, and emergency <a href="/story/news/local/phoenix/2020/02/05/phoenix-cleanup-near-human-services-campus-temporarily-relocates-400/4660687002/">shelters are at near capacity</a>.&#xA0;</li><li>Even with the pandemic, new home prices are still climbing. One leading housing analyst expects metro Phoenix new home prices to <a href="/story/money/real-estate/catherine-reagor/2020/08/02/phoenix-housing-home-sales-climb-back-covid-19-low-metro-area/5539754002/">rise 5% to 6% this year</a> because of&#xA0;rising buyer demand.</li></ul><p class="p-text">The Republic wants to dig even deeper. The Arizona Community Foundation wants&#xA0;to help.</p><p class="p-text">The foundation is making&#xA0;a generous three-year commitment to support&#xA0;The Republic&#x2019;s mission to dig into affordable housing issues, from&#xA0;topics of long standing in the community to new challenges exacerbated by COVID-19.</p><p class="p-text">&#x201C;The Arizona Community Foundation will be focusing on affordable housing over the next three years,&#x201D; said Steve Seleznow, president and CEO of the foundation. &#x201C;The community impact on health, education, homelessness and the economy are driving the need to address this crisis now, and a partnership with The Republic was a logical addition to our ongoing work.</p><p class="p-text">&quot;We believe strongly in the power of quality journalism to shine a light on critically important topics affecting the community and are proud to partner with The Republic on this work.&#x201D;</p><p class="p-text">The two organizations share a strong connection.

The&#xA0;grant also will support the work of The Republic&#x2019;s visual journalists, who will document the issue.</p><p class="p-text">Reagor brings a deep knowledge of housing issues in metro Phoenix. She stays on top of trends via deep connections and skills developed in more than 20 years of exploring the boom and bust cycles of Arizona real estate.

Her expertise on these complex topics has been showcased in her recent reporting on the <a href="/story/news/local/phoenix/2020/07/15/downtown-phoenix-homeless-shelter-wants-add-500-beds/5432837002/">lack of shelter beds</a> and the pervasiveness of the problem across the region.</p><p class="p-text">It&#x2019;s important to note our journalism remains independent from the financial supporters who make the work possible.
