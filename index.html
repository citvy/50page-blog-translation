<div class="entry entry-content"> <p>Demand for&#xA0;daycares&#xA0;in the US&#xA0;has been&#xA0;growing rapidly over the past few years. It&#xA0;is&#xA0;estimated that the industry will surpass $250 billion by the end of 2025&#xA0;(DealStats.com). Even though funding through government&#xA0;channels&#xA0;has been very limited, the industry&#xA0;thrives with its&#xA0;revenue model, charging roughly $5,000-$25,000&#xA0;annually per child at&#xA0;each&#xA0;daycare facility. In this article, daycare businesses&#xA0;from three sales&#xA0;classes of data from BIZMINER (Bizminer.com) are analyzed.</p>
<p><strong>Sales Class 1: Daycares Annual Sales $1-$500,000</strong></p>
<p>The first sales class consists&#xA0;of most of the firms in this analysis (Bizminner.com). These are usually&#xA0;locations&#xA0;which are&#xA0;established in&#xA0;regional communities and have&#xA0;relatively very&#xA0;high cash reserves. They&#xA0;are usually privately-owned&#xA0;startups,&#xA0;and books are maintained by the owner, which&#xA0;usually&#xA0;raise concerns over owner discretionary earnings.</p>

<p>The second sales class topples all the other sales classes in terms of profit percentage after tax. With a very low inventory cost, these daycare business owners establish locations strategically to specifically care for the needs of target customers. With no plans of expanding, these firms can turn into dependable &#x201C;cash cows.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>Sales Class 3: Daycares Annual Sales $1 million-$2.5 million</strong></p>
<p>The third and the final sales class consists of industry giants with the highest net worth and a very good current ratio. These daycares have a good business revenue model with offices situated in the best cities with the least current liabilities on their books. From a parent&#x2019;s point of view, these big names are reliable and trustworthy when it comes down to guardianship of their children in their absence. Several players in this class are publicly listed, audited regularly, and need to maintain certain benchmarks to compete with competitors and market expectations.</p>
<p>The daycare industry is positioned very differently across all three sales classes. Naturally, the largest sales class is valued the most, with most daycares in this range being worth above the $1 million mark. On the other hand, the lower sales classes fail to touch the $500,000 valuation level, respectively. The calculated cap rates increase rapidly from ~25% in the highest sales class toward ~30% in the lower sales classes.</p>
<p><strong>Forecasting 2020</strong></p>
<p>2020 so far hasn&#x2019;t gone according to any industry&#x2019;s&#xA0;plans, especially the plans for the daycare industry. The demand&#xA0;for&#xA0;this business is uncertain.&#xA0;Since the pandemic outbreak,&#xA0;families have been asked to work from home. But Metairie-based business broker and Certified&#xA0;Business Intermediary Russell Bernstein of KW Commercial says, &#x201C;I am getting five times as many calls about businesses for sale than before (the pandemic), and daycares are the most popular target acquisition these days.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Commercial real estate (i.e., just the empty space, but not also the existing operating entity) has also experienced unique trends. There have been talks in the pipeline about reopening daycare facilities with a separate office environment space for working parents who are actually supposed to work from home but are tired of both managing work and taking care of children at home due to school closure.</p>
<p>What lies in the future&#xA0;for the daycare industry, only time will tell.&#xA0;But one thing is sure,&#xA0;the global economy&#xA0;will find its own way to resume,&#xA0;and so will the daycare industry. This business is equally important for working parents as it is for the community.</p>
