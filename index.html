<p>Fortunately, both landlords and their lenders are starting to show more flexibility in negotiations, writes Graiser, who has decades of experience in real estate lease restructurings, dispositions, valuations and acquisitions. &quot;Office landlords around the country are confronting a stark choice&#x2014;either shift into &apos;workout mode&apos; or risk losing important tenants for good.&quot; </p> <p>In <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3011837-1&amp;h=1644543010&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cpexecutive.com%2Fpost%2F4-tips-for-lowering-occupancy-costs-in-the-office-sector%2F&amp;a=the+column">the column</a>, the executive gives office tenants four tips for lowering their occupancy costs.</p>
<p>The first is to <b>be transparent</b>. In the COVID-19 era, the executive notes, landlords need to confirm for themselves that their tenants truly need a break.</p><p>&quot;In restructuring a lease, be able to provide that landlord with highly detailed financials,&quot; he advises. &quot;Office tenants should make a compelling case for how restructuring the lease will support their business strategy and allow them to keep leasing space from that landlord.&quot;</p><p>The second is to <b>be cautious about accepting offers of deferred rental payments</b>. Writes Graiser: &quot;&#x2026;office tenants need to carefully consider the risk to their businesses of being forced to pay back that rent sometime next year.&quot; That&apos;s especially important given that many office users will be facing additional expenses associated with building sanitization, HVAC upgrades, safety-barrier installation and the like, he adds.</p><p>Thirdly, Graiser urges office tenants to <b>think carefully about factors that contribute to their leverage</b>. &quot;For example, if the landlord has a loan coming due, it could be impossible [for the landlord] to refinance if your company were to vacate the property,&quot; he writes. &quot;A wide array of factors&#x2014;from your creditworthiness, to your company&apos;s esteem and recognition in the community&#x2014;are part of the picture here; make sure you don&apos;t neglect your own value.&quot;</p><p>And lastly, Graiser encourages office tenants to <b>consider the property in full context</b>. In particular, they should examine how the pandemic may have changed the areas surrounding their office leaseholds. &quot;Your company may have located its HQ in a central business district because of the vibrancy of nearby retail shops and restaurants,&quot; he explains. &quot;If that CBD is now a ghost town, this should be a factor in the lease-restructuring discussion.&quot;</p><p>Given what&apos;s happening today, Graiser concludes, the odds are good that the office sector will continue to be in &quot;workout mode&quot; for the next two years or more, but landlords are increasingly willing to play ball. A&amp;G, for example, recently saved a <span class="xn-location">Manhattan</span> office user <span class="xn-money">$60 million</span> just by winning an early exit from a single lease. </p><p>&quot;Properly undertaken, portfolio-optimization can better position companies for the challenges of the future&#x2014;whatever surprises they may hold,&quot; he writes.</p><p>The full column is available at:<br class="dnr"><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3011837-1&amp;h=3199630206&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cpexecutive.com%2Fpost%2F4-tips-for-lowering-occupancy-costs-in-the-office-sector%2F&amp;a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cpexecutive.com%2Fpost%2F4-tips-for-lowering-occupancy-costs-in-the-office-sector%2F">https://www.cpexecutive.com/post/4-tips-for-lowering-occupancy-costs-in-the-office-sector/</a></p><p><b><i><u>About A&amp;G Real Estate Partners<br class="dnr"></u></i></b>A&amp;G is a team of seasoned commercial real estate professionals and subject matter experts that delivers strategies designed to yield the highest possible value for clients&apos; real estate.
