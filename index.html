<p>Trends data provider SEMrush shared with Narcity its info on all the ways that the Canadian real estate market has changed over the last six to 12 months.</p>
<p>Based on online searches, SEMrush said that Canadians are increasingly looking for all different kinds of housing but one type really stands out even though it&apos;s not big.</p>
<p>In Atlantic Canada, the searches for <span class="link inline-link "><a href="https://www.narcity.com/travel/ca/nl/newfoundland-tiny-house-airbnb-is-right-on-the-water-and-overlooks-a-world-heritage-site">tiny homes</a></span> for sale have skyrocketed when compared to last year.</p>
<p>According to the data, people in Nova Scotia looked up &quot;tiny homes for sale&quot; so much that there was a 733% increase in interest from January to April 2020 compared to January to April 2019.</p>
<p>There was a 467% increase in New Brunswick and a 200% one in P.E.I. during that same time.</p>
<p>So, people out east must really want to downsize and start living tiny!</p> <p>Across Canada, the average searches for &quot;<span class="link inline-link "><a href="https://www.narcity.com/real-estate/ca/on/ontarios-cheap-tiny-homes-let-you-live-your-best-minimalist-life">tiny homes for sale</a></span>&quot; has increased by 55% since January of this year.</p>
<p>That&apos;s only a few percent lower than searches for full-sized houses for sale which came in at 58%.</p> <p>&quot;The real estate market in Canada&#x2014;and globally&#x2014;is constantly shifting,&quot; said Eugene Levin, chief strategy officer for SEMrush.</p>
<p>While tiny homes are trendy out east, cottages reign supreme when it comes to Canada-wide trends this year.</p>
<p>Searches for cottages that are for sale across the country increased by 200% since January 2020.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there was only a 14% increase for apartments and an 8% increase for condos.</p> <p>At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Canadians were told to <span class="link inline-link "><a href="https://www.narcity.com/news/ca/covid-19-in-canada-canadians-told-to-stay-away-from-their-cottages-this-spring">stay away from their cottages</a></span> to prevent spreading the virus and straining health systems in smaller communities.</p></div></div></article></p></div>
