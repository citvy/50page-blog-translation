<p><b>Song: &#x201C;Therefore I Am&#x201D;</b></p>
<p><span>Up-and-coming pop artist Billie Eilish released a new song called &#x201C;Therefore I Am,&#x201D; a tune of caution to those who try and use her name for fame or clout, as well as a dismissal of her haters. The accompanying music video is filmed on an iPhone and features Eilish prancing around an empty mall, a nod to the simplicity and fun nature of the song and artist herself. Eilish&#x2019;s &#x201C;Therefore I Am&#x201D;</span> <span>is a song for those who mind their own business and disregard the hateful opinions of others, encouraging self-expression and living one&#x2019;s life unapologetically. &#x2013;</span><i><span>KC</span></i></p> <figure id="attachment_20802" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-20802" src="https://csusmchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Vampires_vs._the_Bronx.png" alt width="220"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20802" class="wp-caption-text">Vampires vs. the Bronx is available to stream on Netflix.
