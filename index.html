</div> <h2>What is Stock Sentiment?</h2>
<p>Sentiment is a very short-term indicator that is entirely technical. There is no information about the health of profitability of the underlying company in our sentiment score.</p>
<p>As a technical indicator, news about the stock, or company, such as an earnings release or other event, could move the stock counter to the recent trend.</p>
<p>Recent trends are a good indator of current market sentiments. In its most basic form, stocks that are trending up are desirable by investors while stocks currently falling must be unattractive.</p>
<p><em>InvestorsObserver</em>&apos;s Sentimental Indicator tracks both changes in price and volume to analyze the most recent trends. Typically an increase in volume indicates ongoing trends are getting stronger, while a decrease in volume usually signals an end to the current trend.</p>
<p>Available options can also represent current sentiments for a given stock. Since investors are able to bet on future trends of stocks using options, we consider the ratio of calls to puts when analyzing market sentiments . </p>
